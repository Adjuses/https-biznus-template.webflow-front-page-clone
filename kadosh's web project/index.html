              We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks <br> around the city and
              state are feeling uneasy about <br> the future - we're not sure what the
              future holds <br> either. <br> That said: we know that we love making sure you <br>
              have the gear you need for your adventures, and <br> we're going to keep
              doing that with our team - <br> until the city tells us we can't. <br> But as
              long as folks like yourself support small <br> businesses around the
              city, then we'll be here â€” <br> every day, making sure your orders arrive
              on time. <br />
